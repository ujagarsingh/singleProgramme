Good Morning Sir,

First of all, thank you for giving me this oppurtunity to introduce myself. My name is Ujagar Singh Meena. I am originally from Jaipur and currently live in Ramgarh mode near JAL-MAHAL. And my village is near Ramgarh dam. It is about 35 kilometers from Jaipur.

I did my graduation in BA from Rajasthan University. Currently I have been working at SAG Infotech as a UI Developer from last 2 year.

I belong to a nuclear family. 

I am self motivated, hard working and a disciplined person. My short term goal is to switch company for a career growth and my long term goal is to achieve a good position where I can build my career and help the organization too.

My hobbies are listening to music, cooking and watching tutorials of programming. That's all about me. 

Thanks again for this opportunity.
