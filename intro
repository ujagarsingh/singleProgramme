1. Tell me about yourself.
I've been working in UI Design and Development for about a 2-3 year now. 
Most of my experience has been in e-commerce and retail, but I also have some SaaS experience. I'm passionate about creating long-term value for the customer, especially in the EdTech space. During my last project, I developed an online classroom environment for a media company, which we then used to sell video learning experiences (mostly workshops) to enterprise customers. I know that your company is developing similar online learning products, and I'd like to work with you on them.

2. What attracted you to our company?
I've seen your company consistently listed as one of the top places to work. I've read employee testimonials and heard of your enthusiasm for encouraging employee growth through education, training, and vast resources. I already know that engaged employees produce better work, and that is evident in the most recent campaign you created. I would love to join your innovative team, continue to create great work, and grow within the company by learning new skills.

In five years, I would like to become an engineering lead or team manager. As a full-stack web developer with your business, I know I would be able to take on a number of wide-ranging responsibilities related to the company’s web efforts. This would help me refine my knowledge of all areas of the company’s stack, which could then be applied in a managerial role further down the line.

6. Can you tell me about a time where you encountered a business challenge? How did you overcome it?
7. What are the most important things you are looking for in your next role?
I am excited by the opportunity to work with an innovative, successful company such as your own. I look forward to utilizing the experience I have in technology to help streamline a company’s products for even more successful implementation.
8. Why are you leaving your current job?
"Experience is the best teacher in the world, I've learned so many things from my current company and I'm really thankful for all the people are working there. They helped me whenever there is necessity. But sometimes you need to concentrate on your goals and sometime you feel to use your knowledge, on such thought it'd be better if we look for better opportunities. I've learnt lot and I'll learn wherever knowledge is available. So I'm doing 'abc' kind of work but I really enjoy's 'xyz' kind of work. And thankfully you are looking for 'xyz' kind of knowledgeable persons. Based upon my knowledge and my hard work I think i'm suitable person for this position"
9. What are your salary expectations?
My current total compensation is X. Money’s not the most important thing, what I’m looking for is the right fit. I’m negotiable
10. Do you have any questions for me?
2. Why should we hire you?
I am the best fit for this job profile, due to my outstanding programming (C, C++, C#, HTML, and .Net), networking, analytical and problem solving skills. Also, I have practical experience in many Operating Systems.
3. Why do you want to work here?
I worked for a software company recently. For me, the draw of such a place was two-fold. Firstly, I have a desire to see my creations take shape and for people to use them. Secondly, it was about learning new skills and development methods as I crave the knowledge.
4. What are your goals?
become an expert in a domain, technology, or language such as Performance, Machine Learning, or Javascript
6. When were you most satisfied in your job?
7. What can you do for us that other candidates can't?
I’m an innovative person who wants to get associated with a team that builds great branding strategies. I have done many marketing campaigns during my class projects and my previous internship, and I am aware of the challenges I might face in this job and know how to deal with it. I have three important abilities that most of the candidates cannot offer: With my problem-solving skill, I can improve the campaign performance, have complete knowledge about social media campaigns, and have good experience in email marketing. Combining my knowledge and hard work for this industry, I am pretty sure I will prove to be an ideal candidate for this job.
